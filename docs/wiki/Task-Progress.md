## Parallel Execution Opportunities

Tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel:

### Phase 3.2: Contract Tests (T007-T016)
All contract tests can be developed simultaneously as they test different API endpoints.

### Phase 3.2: Integration Tests (T017-T021)
All integration tests can be developed in parallel as they test different workflows.

### Phase 3.3: Data Models (T022-T027)
All model classes can be implemented simultaneously as they are independent.

### Phase 3.3: Core Services (T028-T033)
All service classes can be implemented in parallel as they have no dependencies.

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 3.1 (Setup tasks)
2. Complete all tests before implementation (TDD)
3. Implement core functionality
4. Integrate components
5. Polish and optimize
