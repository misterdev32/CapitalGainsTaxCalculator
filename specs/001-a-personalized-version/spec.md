# Feature Specification: Crypto Capital Gains Tax Calculator

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-personalized-version`  
**Created**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a personalized version of koinly, a crypto investment tracking for tax calculation and data visualisation for my personal portfolio"

## Project Goals
- Aggregate all crypto transactions from **Binance (primary)**, **Revolut (primary)**, and **3‚Äì4 smaller exchanges** (Coinbase, KuCoin, etc.)
- Automate **data fetching via APIs** where possible (Binance: batch + pagination to cover full history)
- Store data in a **normalized format (CSV/JSON/DB)** for re-use and audit
- Calculate **realized capital gains under Irish CGT rules** (FIFO, 33%, ‚Ç¨1,270 exemption, loss carryover)
- Provide **clear visualizations** to understand gains/losses by year, exchange, and asset
- Deliver **audit-proof records** so filings can be explained retrospectively

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a crypto investor in Ireland, I want to automatically aggregate my cryptocurrency transactions from Binance, Revolut, and other exchanges, calculate my capital gains tax obligations under Irish CGT rules, and generate audit-proof reports so that I can comply with Irish tax regulations and optimize my tax position.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have Binance API credentials configured, **When** I run the data sync, **Then** the system should fetch all historical transactions using batch pagination and store them in normalized format
2. **Given** I have uploaded Revolut CSV exports, **When** I process the data, **Then** the system should normalize the transactions and integrate them with other exchange data
3. **Given** I have transactions from multiple exchanges, **When** I request an Irish CGT report, **Then** I should receive a detailed breakdown showing FIFO cost basis, realized gains/losses, and tax calculations with ‚Ç¨1,270 exemption applied
4. **Given** I want to analyze my tax position, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I should see visualizations showing gains/losses by year, exchange, and asset with clear tax implications
5. **Given** I need to file my taxes, **When** I export the CGT report, **Then** I should receive a CSV/Excel file with audit-proof records that can be submitted to ROS

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Binance API rate limits are exceeded during batch pagination?
- How does the system handle coin-to-coin swaps as taxable events (sell + buy)?
- What happens when transaction fees need to be allocated across multiple assets?
- How does the system handle different time zones and ensure transactions are correctly assigned to Irish tax years?
- What happens when historical price data is unavailable for certain cryptocurrencies or specific dates?
- How does the system handle internal transfers between wallets vs taxable disposals?
- What happens when Binance API endpoints have different data availability (spot vs futures vs margin vs fiat)?
- How does the system handle data gaps where APIs miss certain transaction types that appear in CSV exports?
- What happens when Binance API rate limits are exceeded during large historical data fetches?
- How does the system ensure data consistency when APIs return mutable data vs CSV snapshots?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

## Limitations & Challenges *(mandatory)*

### API Limitations
- **LC-001**: Binance APIs have limited history depth - some endpoints only return last 3 months of data per request
- **LC-002**: Binance splits data across multiple endpoints (spot, futures, margin, fiat) requiring separate API calls and data stitching
- **LC-003**: Binance has strict rate limits (1200 requests/minute) requiring intelligent batching and retry logic
- **LC-004**: Some transaction types (coin-to-coin swaps, staking rewards, airdrops) may not appear cleanly in API endpoints
- **LC-005**: API data is mutable - historical records could change, requiring snapshot storage for audit consistency

### Data Integration Challenges
- **LC-006**: CSV exports from different exchanges have varying formats requiring normalization
- **LC-007**: Revolut and other exchanges don't provide granular API access, forcing CSV-only integration
- **LC-008**: Data gaps between API and CSV sources require reconciliation and gap-filling strategies
- **LC-009**: Exchange-specific data lock-in creates maintenance overhead when adding new exchanges

### Technical Constraints
- **LC-010**: API authentication requires secure key management with read-only permissions
- **LC-011**: Large historical datasets require efficient pagination and storage strategies
- **LC-012**: Real-time price data availability varies by cryptocurrency and time period
- **LC-013**: Time zone handling across multiple exchanges must ensure correct Irish tax year assignment

### Audit & Compliance Risks
- **LC-014**: API data changes could invalidate previously generated tax reports
- **LC-015**: CSV snapshots provide audit trail but require manual refresh and version control
- **LC-016**: Data reconciliation between sources must be transparent and auditable
- **LC-017**: Rate limiting could delay critical tax reporting during peak periods

## Mitigation Strategies *(mandatory)*

### API Data Handling
- **MS-001**: Implement hybrid approach: API for recent data + CSV for historical completeness
- **MS-002**: Use date range pagination with 3-month chunks to work around API limitations
- **MS-003**: Store API responses as immutable JSON snapshots with timestamps for audit trail
- **MS-004**: Implement data reconciliation reports to identify gaps between API and CSV sources
- **MS-005**: Use CSV exports as source of truth for critical tax calculations, API for real-time updates

### Rate Limiting & Performance
- **MS-006**: Implement intelligent batching with configurable delays based on API response times
- **MS-007**: Use background processing for large historical data imports to avoid blocking user operations
- **MS-008**: Implement data caching with TTL to reduce API calls for frequently accessed data
- **MS-009**: Provide progress indicators and resumable imports for large data sets

### Data Quality & Audit
- **MS-010**: Implement data validation rules to catch inconsistencies between sources
- **MS-011**: Provide data lineage tracking showing how each transaction was sourced and processed
- **MS-012**: Implement data quality scoring to identify potentially problematic transactions
- **MS-013**: Create audit reports showing data source reliability and completeness metrics

### Security & Compliance
- **MS-014**: Implement secure credential storage with encryption at rest
- **MS-015**: Use read-only API keys with IP whitelisting where possible
- **MS-016**: Implement data retention policies for audit compliance
- **MS-017**: Provide data export capabilities for regulatory compliance and tax audits

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Transaction**: Normalized transaction record with schema: `date | exchange | asset | action | amount | price (EUR) | fee | tx_id | source` - represents individual buy/sell/swap/transfer events
- **Asset**: Individual cryptocurrency or token with current market data, historical prices in EUR, and metadata for tax calculations
- **CGT Report**: Generated document showing realized gains/losses, FIFO cost basis calculations, and Irish tax implications for specific tax years
- **Exchange**: Data source configuration (Binance API, Revolut CSV, other exchanges) with connection details and import capabilities
- **Portfolio Snapshot**: Point-in-time view of holdings across all exchanges with current valuations and performance metrics
- **Tax Year Summary**: Aggregated CGT data for a specific Irish tax year including gains, losses, net position, and tax due
